# BlackJack
Simulation of a Blackjack game
Project made by Morosan Eric and Patranjel David

The project follows the simulation of a BlackJack session in which the player wants to win _stop (input) money, starting with _start (input) money. The code plays the game after the basic strategy (https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/) with a 6-deck _N times (input).

We chose to implement the best rules a player can have from different BlackJack variants. The simulation shows a chance of winning of _start/_stop, which is a pretty fair chance. However, there is not a single variant of BlackJack with all these rules. Usually, the chance of winning a BlackJack hand is 42.22%, 8.48% for a push and 49.10% for losing, chances that would make our game much harder to win for the player.
